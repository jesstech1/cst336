    Javascript was created by Netscape employee Brendan Eich in 1995.           <br />
    It was inspired by direct competition between Microsoft and Netscape and    <br />
    its ally, Sun Microsystems.                                                 <br /><br />  
    Java was very popular and Eich's language was meant to shipped as a         <br /> 
    companion language to it.  Its name was part of a marketing strategy.       <br /> 
    Originally is was called Mocha.  Yeah, it lacks je ne sais quoi.  Javascript<br />
    though, now that's HOT!                                                     <br /><br /> 
    Now according to the source I am getting my information from, Javascript is <br />
    one of the most hated languages on the planet (article written in 2015).  Yet<br /> 
    it is the standard programming language of the web.                         <br />
