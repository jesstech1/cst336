    The R language was developed to assist statistical computing and graphics work.<br/>
    It is a GNU (GNU's Nt Unix!?  What's with these recursive acronyms?) project   <br/>
    similar to a language called S (You can do your own investiation if you want to<br/>
    know more about that).                                                         <br/><br/>
    R provides a wide range of stat and graph techniques.  The S language is       <br/>
    considered to be the most popular language for stat research.  R is the        <br/>
    open source version.                                                           <br/>
