    PHP is an html embedded scripting language, and we had a taste of how convenient<br />
    it can be in Dr. Lara's class.  It is used for creating beautiful, precious and <br /> 
    dynamic web applications.                                                       <br /><br /> 
    PHP's syntax is a derivative of C, Java, and Perl.                              <br /><br />
    It is open source, and runs on most OSs and webservers.  PHP was an acronym     <br />
    for "Personal Home Page", but later some cheeky fellow recoined its meaning to  <br />
    "HyperText Preprocessor".  It's recursive, the acronym is its own defintion!    <br />
    We'll be learning a lot more about this in class.                               <br /><br />
