    A formal language that uses a set of instructions to reach desired outputs.  <br />
    Hang on, we haven't even reached the part about modern computing yet.        <br />
    Programming langauges have been used to program machines for centuries.      <br />
    Think of automatic musical instruments. These earlier machines were limited  <br />
    in the responses they were capable of.                                       <br /><br/>
    The advent of modern computers gave birth to thousands of programming        <br />
    languages.                                                                   <br /><br />
    We are going to explore the history behind a few of these languages.         <br />
