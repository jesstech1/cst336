    The first OS, GMOS, was created by General Motors to run IBM's 701 Machine back in the 50s.            <br /> 
    Originally OSs were called single-stream batch processing systems.  Data submission                    <br />
    was limited to single group submissions. The computers of the 50s, or mainframes, were                 <br />
    large enough in scale to fill a large room, and required professional operators to run them.           <br />
    Access was limited to government agencies and institutions with enough money to afford to purchase one.<br /><br />
    I aplogize, as this history is more about mainframes than GMOS, but I kept getting links               <br />
    Genetically modified organisms.                                                                        <br /><br />                                
    The takeway here is that the first operating system to hit the market back in the 50s was GMOS.  It was<br />
    born out of some kind of business arrangement between GM and IBM, to support IBM's 701 mainframe.      <br />
    The exact nature of the arrangement is debatable.                                                      <br />
