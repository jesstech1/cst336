    When PCs began to hit the market, IBM needed an operating system         <br />
    for its line of personal computers.  Microsoft bought the rights to      <br />
    86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, and began to tailor it to IBM's   <br />
    requests.  Under license, IBM released it as PC DOS 1.0.                 <br /><br />
    
    MS-DOS became the most widely used of the DOS family of operating systems.<br />
    These OSs relied on floppy disks to store and access the operating system.<br />
    
    Even as it began to fade out of the market, it remained as the underlying <br />
    OS that the first versions of Windows would be based on.                  <br />
