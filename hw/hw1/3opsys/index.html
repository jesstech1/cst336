    According to this uplifting source (see my handy links down there), the field of <br />
    OS Development is one littered with utter abject FAILURE!  Yeah, making one is   <br />
    hard.                                                                            <br /><br />
    An OS manages computer hardware and system resources.  As a student,             <br />
    Try to imagine having to write the hello world app in any language ...           <br />
    then try to imagine having to write all the code that governs hardware           <br />
    and system resource communication to make it work ...                            <br /><br />
    The modern CS student has much to be thankful for.                               <br /><br />
    Let us explore a short history of a few of these operating systems.              <br />
