    Windows is a modern OS of some note, developed by a modest software concern  <br />
    operating out of Redmond, Washington.  It has seen its share of popularity    <br />
    since the mid 80s, and evolved several times since its inception.            <br /><br />
    
    It grew in popularity as its developers had the foresight to get on board    <br />
    the GUI bandwagon.  It relied heavily on mouse input before the mouse        <br />
    became a properly accepted input device.  In a decent display of ingenuity,  <br />
    the developers shipped a game with the OS the educate customers in proper    <br />
    mouse use - it was called Reversi.                                           <br /><br />
    
    Windows is still popular among a percentage of PC owners.                    <br />
