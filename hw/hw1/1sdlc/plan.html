    The Planning stage is essential for Software Development.  This stage should, in a  <br />
    perfect world, involve many meetings and conversations between all the stake        <br />
    holders involved.  The purpose of this initial effort to make sure everyone         <br />
    is on the same page in regards to requirements, cost and risks.  The stakeholders   <br />
    could involve representatives from every department in the company, so clear        <br />
    communication is key.  As software developers, it is in our best interests to ask   <br />
    as many questions as possible.                                                      <br /><br /> 
    
    Imagine for a second that you run a team of programmers, and <span class="eastereggs"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6sbrmcrSuo" target="_blank"

    someone from marketing</a></span>                                                   <br />
    scribbles some notes on a piece of paper and tells you he needs the changes         <br />
    implemented immediately. Is this change offical?  Does he have approval to make this<br />
    request?  Once you finish the changes, is he going to decide he doesn't like it,    <br />
    then pull your team off other projects, again, to make more frivolous changes until <br />
    he is finally satisfied?                                                            <br /><br />
    
    A good way to avoid all that is to have an in depth discussion with the person,     <br />
    pose many questions, and get him to think more critically about what the changes    <br />
    he truly requires.  Also, it helps ensure our understanding of those requirements.  <br /><br />
