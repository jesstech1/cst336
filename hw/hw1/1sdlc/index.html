    Every product in market has some kind of life cycle that <br />
    measures its existence from ideation to the time when    <br />
    it is finally pulled off the shelves for good.  Software <br />
    is no different.                                         <br /><br /> 
    
    The Software Development Life Cycle (or SDLC) is a       <br />
    system or process that governs how software developers   <br />
    design, build, test, and deploy their products.          <br /><br />
    
    There are many different SDLCs, and different            <br />
    insitutions may give you different definitions and       <br />
    varying numbers of steps on how to proceed while         <br />
    developing software.                                     <br /><br />
    
    With that being said, there is an international SDLC     <br />
    Standard.  It is called ISO/IEC 12207, and it wants to   <br />
    be the one true standard for all Software Development in <br />

    I am just going to stick to four basic steps, ones that  <br />
    I was made aware of while testing software for a living. <br /><br />
    
    Plan, Implement, Test, and Deploy.                       <br /><br />
