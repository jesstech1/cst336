    The Implementation stage is <span class="eastereggs"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V00ZIGnlJnQ" 
    title="What I tell other people I do..." target="_blank">where we get to work</a></span>, after we have gathered as much    <br/>
    information as we can about the task ahead of us.  There could be physical elements <br />
    involved in the process.  We will certainly be writing code at this point.          <br />
    Still, even with the planning stage behind us, we should treat every design doc as  <br />
    living document that will change over time.  Last minute considerations always pop  <br />
    up - then we start hearing the word "agile" over and over again in meetings.        <br /><br />
    
    Do you like to work overtime for free, because you are paid a salary, and not by the<br />
    hour?  Well you do now.                                                             <br /><br />
    
    We haven't discussed testing yet, but during this phase we will certainly be        <br />
    testing our code.                                                                   <br /><br />
    
    When you click on the source link below and explore the page that appears, you will <br />
    see that SDLC can also stand for SYSTEM Development Life Cycle.  It was my purpose   <br />
    to show you how similar it is to the software version.  The decription of the       <br />
    of the implementation stage is sufficient.                                          <br /><br />
