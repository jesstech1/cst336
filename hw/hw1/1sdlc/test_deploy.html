    According to Techopedia, Testing is the process of finding flaws and defects <br />
    in created in software.  (it is also a great way to make enemies within      <br />
    the dev team.)                                                               <br /><br />
    Documentation is a key element in the testing effort, as it is vital to keep <br />
    Track of the overall state of the product.                                   <br /><br />
    Once the software is in a stable enough state, and all the necessary         <br />
    stakeholders have approved, the software is deployed (sold to customers).    <br /><br />
    After deployment, there is a maintenance phase where bugs found after        <br />
    deployment are addressed.                                                    <br />
