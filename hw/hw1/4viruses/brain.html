    The brain virus was the first PC virus.  It targeted 5.2" floppy disks.  <br />
    The Alvi brothers developed Brain, which replaced the boot sector of     <br />
    the flopy with a virus.  This was meant was a warning to people          <br />
    who made illegal copies of their software.                               <br /><br />
