    A computer virus is a piece of computer code that can damage machines and <br />
    copy itself into new hosts.  The idea was discussed back in the 40s by    <br />
    mathematician John von Neumann.  You can read about it a paper published  <br />
    in the 60s, "Theory of Self Replicating Automata".                        <br /><br />

    You know what, scratch that last part.  They are sinsiter creations, be afraid!!!<br />
    Upon our exploration, you may notice how the humble beginnings of some computer viruses <br />
    have laid the ground work for more sinster applications.                                <br />
