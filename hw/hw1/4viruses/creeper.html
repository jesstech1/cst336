    The Creeper program was written in the 70s by BBN employee, Bob Thomas. <br />
    It was a proof of concept effort.  Thomas wanted to see if it was       <br />
    possible to create a self replicating program.  The creeper would       <br />
    remove it self from previosuly infected hosts.                          <br /><br />
    
    All it did was output a single message, "I'M the CREEPER.  CATCH ME     <br />
    IF YOU CAN!"                                                            <br /><br />
    Let's all thank Mr. Thomas for his contribution to the virus development<br /> 
    industry.  **APPLAUSE**                                                 <br />
