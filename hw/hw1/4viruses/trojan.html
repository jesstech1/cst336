    A Trojan virus is piggy backed on another seemingly harmless program.    <br />
    Hidden within another program, does whatever it wants without permission <br />
    from the user.                                                           <br /><br />
    The first Trojan was created when John Walker wanted a convenient way    <br />
    to send a popular game to his friends.  He wrote a program called        <br />
    Prevade, which installed itself with the game he was sending.            <br />
    Once installed, Prevade would make a copy of the game in any directory   <br />
    that didn't have it...                                                   <br />
    The source says there was no malicious intent here...                    <br />
    ... and I am still fuzzy on how this made distribution easier.           <br /><br />
    
    I think all my friends need a copy of the latest MMORPG in every directory<br />
    on their computer.  I need Prevade!  Or its 2018 equivalent!              <br /><br />
